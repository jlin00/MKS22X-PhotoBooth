# Photo Booth/Editor

The core of our final project is a Photo Booth/Editor created in Processing through the Capture class. Processing provides a unique opportunity for smooth graphics and a Photo Booth/Editor would efficiently use our resources to make a project that is both useful and aesthetic. In our Photo Booth/Editor, users will be able to, of course, take pictures of themselves and edit them afterwards. Features include adding filters in the photo booth and placing stickers in the editor. Additionally, images are able to be stored or deleted. Other features may be implemented depending on our usage of Processing and our ability to change the look of the camera.
